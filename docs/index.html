                <p class="intro-large">I wanted to understand what makes some TED talks succeed while others don't.</p>
                <p>So I downloaded transcripts of 4,005 talks and extracted their opening lines. Then I looked for patterns in the data.</p>
                <p>I expected to find some correlation between length, complexity, or structure and view counts. Maybe successful talks would start with questions, or use specific words, or follow some template.</p>
                <p class="intro-emphasis">The actual pattern was simpler than that.</p>

                <p>When you see "(Laughter)" in a transcript, it means the speaker got a laugh. TED transcribers note audience reactions. So we can measure something that's usually unmeasurable.</p>

            <h2>What this suggests</h2>
            <p class="conclusion-text">The correlation with laughter is real, but it's probably not causal in the way you'd think.</p>
            <p class="conclusion-emphasis">The opener doesn't make the talk. The talk makes the opener.</p>
            <p>Ken Robinson's "I'm leaving" works because of what follows it. The joke is good because the next 18 minutes justify it. If the talk were bad, the opener would fall flat.</p>
            <p>So the laughter isn't causing success. It's a signal of something else: the speaker's skill. If you can make people laugh in the first 30 seconds, you probably know what you're doing.</p>
            <p>The data can't tell us how to give a good talk. But it can tell us what good speakers have in common.</p>
